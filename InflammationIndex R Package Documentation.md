# InflammationIndex R Package

Package for R, which works with the output of the MicroMorphologyAnalysis.ijm script. The R package is used to process and format the output of this imageJ script, before using the data to build a PCA-based composite measure that is sensitive to inflammation-associated morphological changes. Documentation for the functions can be viewed in R once the package is loaded.
