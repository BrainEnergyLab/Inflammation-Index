# Inflammation-Index
This is the repo for Inflammation Index Package for R, which works with the output of the MicroMorphologyAnalysis.ijm script. This script semi-automatically identifies and extracts morphological measurements from microglial cells, and the R package is used to process and format the output of this, before using the data to build a PCA-based composite measure that is sensitive to inflammation-associated morphological changes
