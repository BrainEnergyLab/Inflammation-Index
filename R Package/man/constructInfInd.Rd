\title{Wrapper function. Takes the output of morphPreProcessing filtered for training conditions,
and returns a PCA object that can be used to build an Inflammation Index optimised for the TCS value and number of metrics
that lead to the greatest sensitivity to the training conditions}
\usage{
constructInfInd(
  procDat,
  method,
  noDesc = 5:15,
  labCols = c("Animal", "Treatment", "TCSValue", "CellNo", "UniqueID")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{procDat}{A data.table object output by morphPreProcessing that is filtered to only contains 2 Treatment values (training data)}

\item{method}{A string that indicates what method to use to select the optimal Inflammation Index. Can either be 'p value' or 'AUC'}

\item{noDesc}{An integer vector that indicates what different combinations of the best descriptors we want to try building our Index using}

\item{labCols}{A string vector of the ID columns in procDat}
}
\value{
A PCA object
