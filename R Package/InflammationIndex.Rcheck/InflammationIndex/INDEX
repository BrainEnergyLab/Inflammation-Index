InflammationIndex       InflammationIndex: A package for analysing
                        microglial morphology
addMissingInfo          Adds in values missing from each data type
constructInfInd         Function to Build the Inflammation Index from
                        Output of morphPreProcessing
convertHCtouM           Converts FracLac metrics from pixels into the
                        correct units to align with Parameter data
filterForVector         Remove vector elements that don't match a
                        filter, but retain original vector indices
formatFracLacFiles      Applies formatting to the FracLac data to align
                        it with non FracLac data types
formatNames             Formats labelling column names to be identical
                        across different data types
formatUniqueID          Add a unique ID for each animal, treatment,
                        TCS, and cell, to our files
getAnimalAndTreatmentIDs
                        Return a list of animal and treatment IDs from
                        the image storage directory used with the
                        Microglia Morphology Analysis Fiji package
getFileLocations        Return a list containing all the information
                        needed to read in data from the Microglia
                        Morphology Analysis Fiji plugin
getFracLacMaskNames     Extract a 'Mask Name' from the FracLac / Hull
                        and Circularity file locations that matches the
                        format of the Parameters data types
getIDFromLocations      Retrieve ID info from a file path
getTCSFromFracLacLocations
                        Retrieve the TCS value (mask size) from a
                        vector of file locations. Unlike
                        getTCSFromLocations(), this is suitable for use
                        with FracLac and Hull and Circularity data
getTCSFromLocations     Retrieve the TCS value (mask size) from a
                        vector of file locations
infInd                  Function to run for full inflammation index
                        construction and data preprocessing
mergeDataTogether       Merge all our different data types together
                        into a single data.table object
morphPreProcessing      Wrapper function for all morphology data
                        preprocessing for data output by the Microglia
                        Morphology Analysis Fiji Plugin
morphPreProcessing      Function to Format and Read In Microglia
                        Morphology Data
readInFile              Formatted function for reading in morphology
                        data output by the Microglia Morphology
                        Analysis Fiji plugin
readInRawData           Takes the output of getFileLocations and uses
                        its contents with the readInFile function to
                        read in Microglia Morphology Analysis Fiji
                        plugin data
removeUnusedMetrics     Removes metrics from our data that we aren't
                        considering in Inflammation Index construction
retainCommonCells       Remove all cells that aren't common across
                        different data types
returnVectorOfMatchingValues
                        Return the strings that match a vector of
                        strings
