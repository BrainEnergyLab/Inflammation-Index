\title{Function to Format and Read In Microglia Morphology Data
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{Function reads in data generated by the microMorphologyAnalysis.ijm imageJ script, cleans it up,
formats it appropriately, and returns it
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
Pre-Processing Morphology Data
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{pixelSize}{Numeric value in um for the size of a pixel (assuming square pixels)}
  \item{morphologyWD}{String path pointing to the output directory from the microMorphologyAnalysis.ijm script}
  \item{TCSExclude}{String vector of TCS values to exclude from preprocessing in the form c("TCS200", "TCS300") etc., not essential}
  \item{animalIDs}{String vector of IDs for animals in the dataset, should match animal names on the images, essential}
  \item{treatmentIDs}{String vector of the treatments applied to the animals, should match names on the images}
  \item{useFrac}{Boolean describing whether to use fracLac analysis data from ImageJ}

\value{Returns data table where each column is a different measure, each row is a cell, including identifiers
for animal ID and treatment ID
